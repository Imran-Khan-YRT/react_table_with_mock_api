# Start the project

`npm start` in server

then `npm start` in client

# react_table_with_mock_api

`npx create-react-app ./`

# created an api from `https://www.mockaroo.com/`--pretty cool

# Since the data is random every time, We need to create a static api with the help of a set of data stored locally

# use cors to avoid cross origin
